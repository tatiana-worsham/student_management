Project Title: Student Management System

Objective:
Develop a Java-based Student Management System (SMS) that can handle various operations, including adding students, tracking grades, calculating averages, and generating reports. The goal is to reinforce concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and user interaction using Java.

Project Overview:
Students will work in groups (3–4 members) to create a fully functional SMS. The system will be a console-based application with the following features:
- Adding, removing, and updating student records
- Tracking student grades for multiple subjects
- Generating reports (e.g., average grade, highest/lowest performers)
- Saving and loading student data from a file

Requirements:
1. User Interaction:
   - Use a `Scanner` for user input to interact with the system.
   - The system should display a menu with options for users to select operations like adding, removing, or viewing student details.

2. Class Design:
   - Create at least three key classes: 
     - `Student` (attributes: ID, name, grades, etc.)
     - `Subject` (attributes: name, grade, etc.)
     - `StudentManagementSystem` (handling all system operations)
   - Apply the principles of Encapsulation to ensure data hiding.
   - Use Inheritance and Polymorphism where appropriate (e.g., for handling different types of students or grading systems).

3. File Handling:
   - Implement functionality to save and load the student records to and from a text file.
   - Ensure proper file handling with `try-catch` blocks to handle errors.

4. Error Handling:
   - Implement input validation (e.g., check for valid grade inputs between 0 and 100).
   - Use exception handling to manage incorrect inputs or file errors.

5. Reports:
   - The system should generate reports such as:
     - Average grade for each student
     - Highest and lowest grades for a specific subject
     - A list of students sorted by grade

Key Topics Covered:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- File I/O: Reading and writing files in Java
- Error Handling: Exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Data Structures: Arrays, ArrayLists, or HashMaps to store student records and grades
- Basic Algorithms: Sorting and searching for student data
- Teamwork & Collaboration: Version control and role assignment within the group

Deliverables:
1. Codebase: A fully functional Java application with well-structured classes and methods.
2. Documentation:
   - Brief report explaining the system’s design and the responsibilities of each group member.
   - Comments within the code to explain the logic and flow.
3. Presentation: Each group will present their project in class, demonstrating the features and explaining their design choices.
4. GitHub Repository: Teams are encouraged to use version control (Git) to manage their project, with regular commits showing collaboration between members.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Functionality: Does the system work as expected, covering all the required features?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Are OOP principles applied effectively?
- Error Handling: Are potential issues like invalid input and file errors managed properly?
- Collaboration: Did all group members contribute, and was version control used effectively?
- Presentation: How well is the system demonstrated, and are the design decisions clearly explained?

Timeline:
- Week 1: Group formation, project planning, and system design
- Week 2–3: Implement core features (student records, basic operations)
- Week 4: Implement file handling and advanced features (report generation)
- Week 5: Testing, debugging, and preparing for the presentation
