/**
 * This a Java-based Student Management System that allows users to add, delete,
 * and update student records. The system also allows users to track students's
 * grades for multiple subjects. The system will generate reports for average
 * grades, highest grades, and lowest grades. It will also save and load student
 * data from a file. Requirements: 1. User Interaction: - Use a `Scanner` for
 * user input to interact with the system. - The system should display a menu
 * with options for users to select operations like adding, removing, or viewing
 * student details.

 *  *2. Class Design: - Create at least three key classes: - `Student`
 * (attributes: ID, name, grades, etc.) - `Subject` (attributes: name, grade,
 * etc.) - `StudentManagementSystem` (handling all system operations) - Apply
 * the principles of Encapsulation to ensure data hiding. - Use Inheritance and
 * Polymorphism where appropriate (e.g., for handling different types of
 * students or grading systems).

 *  *3. File Handling: - Implement functionality to save and load the student
 * records to and from a text file. - Ensure proper file handling with
 * `try-catch` blocks to handle errors.

 *  *4. Error Handling: - Implement input validation (e.g., check for valid grade
 * inputs between 0 and 100). - Use exception handling to manage incorrect
 * inputs or file errors.

 *  *5. Reports: - The system should generate reports such as: - Average grade for
 * each student - Highest and lowest grades for a specific subject - A list of
 * students sorted by grade
